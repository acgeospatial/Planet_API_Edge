# Planet_API_Edge
Using the Planet API to download cloud free images and then run edge detection on them using openCV

Two Python 2.7 files here, firstly download using your Planet API key it will run an edge detection and second Python file will reclass that edge detection if you need to, in the example it will set the values to 0 and 1, but you can alter these if necessary.

More information about how I did the edge detect is available here
